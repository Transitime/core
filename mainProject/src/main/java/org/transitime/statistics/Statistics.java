	 * Returns a filtered mean that is biased to be conservative. First, loops

	 * average, the remaining datapoints, as long as there are at least data

	 * which means that 68% + (100% - 68%)/2 = 84% of the time the actual value
	 * would be at least as large as the value returned by this method.

	 * This method is useful for when need to be somewhat conservative, such as
	 * when determine expected stop time at a terminal. For such a situation
	 * want to take into account when vehicle really leaves the terminal so want
