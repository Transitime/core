/**
 * The schedule based predictions module runs in the background. Every few
 * minutes it looks for blocks that do not have an associated vehicle. For these
 * blocks the module creates a schedule based vehicle at the location of the
 * beginning of the block and generates predictions for the entire block that
 * are based on the scheduled departure time. The purpose of this module is to
 * generate predictions well in advance even if vehicles are assigned just a few
 * minutes before a vehicle is scheduled to start a block. This feature should
 * of course only be used if most of the time the blocks are actually run. It
 * should not be used for agencies such as SFMTA where blocks/trips are often
 * missed because would then be often providing predictions when no vehicle will
 * arrive.
 * <p>
 * Schedule based predictions are removed once a regular vehicle is assigned to
 * the block or the schedule based vehicle is timed out via TimeoutHandlerModule
 * due to it being transitime.timeout.allowableNoAvlForSchedBasedPredictions
 * after the scheduled departure time for the assignment.
