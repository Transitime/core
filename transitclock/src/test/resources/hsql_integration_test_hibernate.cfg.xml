        useful since it duplicates the output of the SQL.
        format_sql makes sql more readable but takes up
        more space. OK for now but should disable in the
        future. use_sql_comments adds comments that might
        be nice, but again, should probably be disabled
        in the future. -->

         following params tells Hibernate to use this pooler. It is 
         important to use this one instead of the standard hibernate one
         because the Hibernate one is not for use in production.
         Documentation on the parameters for C3P0 can be found at

        NOTE: when timed where program and db running on same laptop
        setting batch_size to 25 actually hurt performance by a few
        percent. Probably much more important when db is remote and
        network traffic could bog down the thread that is writing. -->
