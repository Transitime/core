/**
 * This code is called on the client side when RMI object is accessed.
 * The RMI stub methods could be called directly but then one would
 * have no control over the invocation. This is a great use of a proxy
 * object with a custom InvocationHandler. We proxy the RMI stub and then when
 * any of the remote methods are called this class' invocation handler adds 
 * logging, timing, and handles exceptions. This way we can make sure that
 * a call will work properly even if the server or the registry is 
 * restarted or if there is some kind of temporary network problem.
