 * To be called when webapp starts up so that the configuration xml or
 * properties file is read in. The webapp web.xml file should be configured to
 * associate this class as a listener so that contextInitialized() is
 * automatically called at webapp startup. And the initialization parameter
 * transitclock_config_file_location needs to be set to specify the config file to
 * read in.
 * <p>
 * When running Tomcat within Eclipse it is most likely easiest to just set the
 * necessary Java properties in the Debug Configurations VM properties.
 * <p>
 * This class in in the main transitclock package so that it can be used by all
