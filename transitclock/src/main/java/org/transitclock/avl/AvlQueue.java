/**
 * A queue of AvlClient runnables that can be used with a ThreadPoolExecutor.
 * Implements by subclassing a ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable> where the Runnable
 * is an AvlClient. Also keeps track of the last AVL report per vehicle. When
 * getting data from queue, if the data is obsolete (a new AVL report has been
 * received for the vehicle) then that element from the queue is thrown out and
 * the next item is retrieved until a non-obsolete one is found.
 * <p>
 * Extended ArrayBlockingQueue class so that don't have to create a blocking
 * queue from scratch.
 * <p>
 * Note: wanted to extend from ArrayBlockingQueue<AvlClient> but that didn't
 * work for the ThreadPoolExecutor which expects a BlockingQueue<Runnable>. So
 * had to resort to doing ugly casts.
