 * Yes, this is a nuisance. If Hibernate Session class is used instead of the
 * JPA EntityManager class then all annotated classes have to be explicitly
 * added to the Configuration object. Don't want to get into using the JPA
 * EntityManager class for now (just trying to learn Hibernate based on books
 * such as Harnessing Hibernate). So need to do this.
 * 
 * These annotated classes could also be listed in the hibernate.cfg.xml config
 * file but that would be difficult to maintain. Each application might already
 * have a modified hibernate config file. Don't want to have to have each app
 * modify their config file when new annotated classes are added. Therefore it
 * is best to configure these classes programmatically.
