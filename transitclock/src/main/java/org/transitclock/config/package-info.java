/**
 * The classes used as part of specifying the configuration parameters for an 
 * application. These parameters can be set either through command line options
 * or through a configuration file. Default values are specified when each 
 * parameter is declared.  
 * <p>
 * Parameters are declared in a Java class as static members. An example is:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 	public static String getProjectId() {
 *    return projectId.getValue();
 *  }
 *  private static StringConfigValue projectId = 
 *    new StringConfigValue("transitclock.core.projectId", "sfmta");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Such a parameter can be set either using a command line java property when the 
 * application is invoked, such as:
 * <code>
 * -Dtransitclock.core.projectId=mbta
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Or in a configuration file:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <?xml version="1.0"?>
 * <transitclock>
 *   <core>
 *     <projectId>
 *       sfmta
 *     </projectId>
 *     <defaultBreakTimeSec>
 *       120
 *     </defaultBreakTimeSec>
 *   </core>
 * </transitclock>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Most parameters should be declared in org.transitimie.configData package.
 * <p>
 * Currently the configuration information is only read in at application
 * startup. In the future would like to make this dynamic.
