/**
 * The ConfigFile class provides a way of handling parameters that can be
 * updated without having to restart the application. The parameters can be
 * access efficiently so that they can be accessed in loops that are frequently
 * executed. This class is useful for parameters that are system wide and often
 * have a default. Such params are not best stored in a database because with a
 * db it can be harder to see what all the values are or to copy the values from
 * one project to another. It can also be harder to keep track of changes when
 * such params are in a database.
 * <p>
 * An additional goal of Config is for all params to be processed when the
 * config file is read, both at startup and when file is reread. This is
 * important because then if there are any processing problems those problems
 * are noticed and must be dealt with immediately (instead of them occurring in
 * an lazy fashion, perhaps when no one is available to deal with them). But
 * this goal would mean that the params would need to be defined in config files
 * so they would all be dealt with at startup. For many situations want the
 * params to be defined where they are used since that would make them easier to
 * support. But then they wouldn't get initialized until the Java class is
 * actually accessed.
 * <p>
 * For each parameter configured in the file the property is written as a system
 * property if that system property is not yet defined. This way all parameters
 * are available as system properties, even non-transitclock ones such as for
 * hibernate or logback. Java properties set on the command line take precedence
 * since the properties are not overwritten if already set.
 * <p>
 * The params are configured in an XML or a properties file. The member
 * processConfig() first process a file named transitclock.properties if one
 * exists in the classpath. Then files specified by the Java system property
 * transitclock.configFiles . If the file has a .xml suffix then it will be
 * processed as XML. Otherwise it will be processed as a regular properties
 * file. Multiple config files can be used. Each XML file should have a
 * corresponding configuration class such as CoreConfig.java. In the
 * XXXConfig.java class the params are specified along with default values.
 * <p>
 * Multiple threads can read parameters simultaneously. The threads should call
 * readLock() if it is important to update the parameters in a consistent way,
 * such as when more than a single parameter are interrelated.
 * <p>
 * Logback error logging is not used in this class so that logback can be not
 * accessed until after the configuration is processed. In this way logback can
 * be configured using a configuration file to set any logback Java system
 * properties such as logback.configurationFile .
