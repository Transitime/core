/**
 * For automatically assigning a vehicle to an available block by determining
 * both spatial and temporal match. When there is a match for an AVL report then
 * a previous AVL report is also investigated to make sure that the vehicle
 * really is moving along a trip.
 * <p>
 * Tries to match to every non-assigned block. Looks only at the trips that are
 * currently active so that doesn't try to look at all possibilities. Caches
 * matches for trip patterns so that doesn't need to do a spatial match to a
 * trip pattern multiple times. Stationary vehicles are not matched because
 * system requires a previous AVL report that is a minimum distance away from
 * the current report. Even with all of this optimization it can take a while to
 * match a vehicle since have to look at every stop path for each available trip
 * pattern. For an agency with ~250 available blocks this can take about 1/2 a
 * second.
