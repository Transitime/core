/**
 * For determining Arrival/Departure times based on a new GPS report and
 * corresponding TemporalMatch.
 * <p>
 * This code unfortunately turned out to be rather complicated such that all the
 * goals could be met. But the Arrival/Departure generation is critical because
 * it servers as the foundation for both determining historic travel and stop
 * times and for schedule adherence reports. Therefore they must be as accurate
 * as possible.
 * <p>
 * The goals for the Arrival/Departure generation are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Must be as accurate as possible</li>
 * <li>Must work whether the AVL reporting rate is every few seconds or just
 * once every few minutes</li>
 * <li>Must work even though stop locations and AVL locations are not completely
 * accurate. If vehicle stops 40m before the stop the arrival should still be
 * determined as accurately as possible.</li>
 * <li>Arrival, Departure, and Match times must be unique for a vehicle such
 * that Departure for a stop is always after the Arrival. And the Match which is
 * not at a stop will be between the Departure time for one stop and the Arrival
 * time for the subsequent stop.</li>
 * <li>Arrival times at end of trip are recorded even if there are no other AVL
 * reports associated with that trip. This is important because the last stop
 * for a trip is always considered a timepoint for schedule adherence reports.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Key method used to achieve the goals is to not just interpolate between AVL
 * reports but to extrapolate in order to determine when a vehicle really
 * arrives/departs a stop. If would just interpolate then wouldn't be taking the
 * time actually stopped at the stop into account. Instead, need to use travel
 * speed and distance to determine from the last AVL report when arrived or
 * departed a stop.
